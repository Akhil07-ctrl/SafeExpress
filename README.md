## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Render](https://render.com/) accounts for deployment (optional)

### Backend Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd Backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create an `.env` and set your MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and admin secret code.

3. **Start the backend server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The backend runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd Frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create an `.env` and set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and `VITE_SOCKET_URL` to your backend URLs.

3. **Start the frontend dev server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

4. **Build for production:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   The built files are placed in the `dist/` directory.

## Usage

- Register as **Admin** (requires secret code), **Driver**, or **Customer**.
- Admin can add vehicles, create deliveries, and view reports.
- Drivers see their assigned deliveries and update status/location.
- Customers track their orders and see driver location in real time.

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** Deploy the `Frontend` folder to Vercel.
- **Backend:** Deploy the `Backend` folder to Render or any Node.js hosting.
- Update environment variables accordingly.
