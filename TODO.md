# TODO: Fix 404 Error for Payment Intent Endpoint

## Issue Analysis
- The frontend is making a POST request to `https://safeexpress.onrender.com/api/payments/create-payment-intent`
- The server returns 404 (Not Found), indicating the route is not available on the deployed backend
- Other endpoints like `/api/auth/register` return 400 (Bad Request), confirming the server is running but the payments route is missing
- Local backend code includes the payment routes and controller correctly

## Root Cause
The deployed backend on Render does not include the latest code with payment routes, or the deployment failed to include the payment-related files.

## Steps to Fix
1. **Verify Local Code**: Ensure all payment-related files are present and correct
   - Backend/routes/paymentRoutes.js
   - Backend/controllers/paymentControllers.js
   - Backend/index.js (routes mounting)
2. **Commit Changes**: Push all changes to the Git repository
3. **Redeploy Backend**: Trigger a new deployment on Render to include the payment routes
4. **Test Endpoint**: After deployment, test the payment intent endpoint
5. **Update Frontend**: If needed, ensure frontend environment variables are correct

## Files to Check
- Backend/index.js: Confirm payment routes are mounted
- Backend/routes/paymentRoutes.js: Confirm route definition
- Backend/controllers/paymentControllers.js: Confirm controller implementation
- Frontend/src/utils/api.js: Confirm base URL
- Frontend/src/pages/payment.jsx: Confirm API call

## Status
- [x] Analyzed the issue
- [ ] Verified local code correctness
- [ ] Committed changes to Git
- [ ] Redeployed backend on Render
- [ ] Tested the endpoint
